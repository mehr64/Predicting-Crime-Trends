# Predicting-Crime-Trends
### Predicting Crime Trends using Machine Learning Models
This project aims to predict crime trends using various machine learning models. The dataset consists of crime statistics from different regions over several years. By applying data preprocessing techniques and employing models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, the goal is to provide insights into crime patterns and trends.

## Features:
Data preprocessing using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn),
Crime prediction using machine learning algorithms,
Visualizations to understand crime patterns over time,
Evaluation of models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE)
## Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn),
SQL and Apache Hive for data queries,
PySpark for large-scale data processing,
Power BI for data visualization
